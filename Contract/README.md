# MoonWorld
Testing the creation of a common token based on TRC20
The Moonworld project is for the purpose of learning and researching blockchain technology.
The code used in the project was created based on the code created and published by many developers.
The code used in the project is constructed under a public license, etc., so no ownership is acknowledged to the developer of the project.
Be careful when using these codes, as they can cause unsafe or unexpected results.
The project developer is not responsible for any kind of damage/loss caused by the use of the code of the project by a third party.
Looking forward to advice/code modifications/assistance from expert engineers.
